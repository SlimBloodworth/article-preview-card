## My process
I started with the outside in and top to bottom for this layout which made it easier to adjust the responsiveness as I went. I also wanted to play more with SCSS.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- SCSS
- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned a bit more about SCSS and how it inteacts with the DOM.

### Continued development

I will be delving more into using SCSS and playing around with more things in JavaScript on future projects.
